# How to contribute <a name="Contribution"></a>

There are lots of ways to contribute to the project. People with different 
expertise can help to improve the web content, the documentation, the code, 
and the tests. Even this README file is a result of collaboration of multiple
people.

* __infrastructure-provisioning__ : Much of the logic of the project is in this
module. Here's your chance to get elbow-deep into machine learning, Tensorflow,
R, Jupiter, [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/), containers, and more.
* __integration-tests__ : A software project is as good as its tests are. Following 
this simple idea, we are trying to cover the integration capabilities with 
automated tests. If you're passionate about the quality - please consider
chiming in.
* __maven__ : The build system - the heart of any project. If you think Maven is 
too old-fashioned, create a PR and move us to [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org/)!
* __doc__ : Have you seen a project that doesn't need to improve its documentation?!
* __website__ : We are using GH pages to build and manage the site's content. 
If you're interested in making it better, check-out `gh-pages` branch and dig in.
If you are not familiar with the [Github Pages](https://dlab.apache.org/) - check it out,
it's pretty simple yet powerful!
* __giving feedback__ : Tell us how you use DLab, what was great and what was not 
so much. Also, what are you expecting from it and what would you like to see in 
the future? Opening [an issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dlab/issues) will grab our
attention. Seriously, this is the great way to contribute!

#### Roles
Much like projects in [ASF](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#roles), 
DLab recognizes a few roles. Unlike ASF's projects, our structure is a way simpler.
There are only two types:
  * __A Contributor__ is a user who contributes to a project in the form of code 
  	or documentation. Developers take extra steps to participate in a project,
  	are active on the developer forums, participate in discussions, 
  	provide PRs (patches), documentation, suggestions, and criticism.
  	Contributors are also known as developers.
  * __A Committer__ is a developer that was given write access to the code 
  	repository. Not needing to depend on other people to commit their patches,
  	they are actually making short-term decisions for the project. By submitting 
  	your code or other content to the project via PR or a patch, a Committer
  	agrees to transfer the contribution rights to the Project.
  From time to time, the project's committership will go through the list of 
  contributions and make a decision to invite new developers to become a project
  committer.


#### RTC model

DLab supports Review-Then-Commit model of development. The following rules are 
used in the RTC process:
  * a developer should seek peer-review and/or feedback from other developers
  	through the PR mechanism (aka code review).
  * a developer should make a reasonable effort to test the changes before 
  	submitting a PR for review.
  * any non-document PR is required to be opened for at least 24 hours for
    community feedback before it gets committed unless it has an explicit +1
    from a committer
  * any non-document PR needs to address all the comment and reach consensus
    before it gets committed without a +1 from other committers
  * a committer can commit documentation patches without explicit review process.
  	However, we encourage you to seek the feedback.
