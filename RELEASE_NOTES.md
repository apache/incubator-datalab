- implemented login via KeyCloak to support integration with multiple SAML and OAUTH2 identity providers
- added DLab version into WebUI
- augmented ‘Environment management’ page
- added possibility to tag Notebook from UI
- added possibility to terminate computational resources via scheduler

**GCP:**
- added possibility to create Notebook/Data Engine from an AMI image

**AWS and GCP:**
