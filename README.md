# What is DataLab? <a name="What_is_DataLab"></a>

DataLab is an essential toolset for analytics. It is a self-service Web Console, used to create and manage exploratory 
environments. It allows teams to spin up analytical environments with best of breed open-source tools just with a 
single click of the mouse. Once established, environment can be managed by an analytical team itself, leveraging simple 
and easy-to-use Web Interface.

----------------------------
# Logical architecture <a name="Logical_architecture"></a>

The following diagram demonstrate high-level logical architecture.

![Logical architecture](doc/logical_architecture.png)

The diagram shows main components of DataLab, which is a self-service for the infrastructure deployment and interaction 
with it. The purpose of each component is described below.

## Self-Service

Self-Service is a service, which provides RESTful user API with Web User Interface for data scientist. It tightly 
interacts with Provisioning Service and Database. Self-Service delegates all user\`s requests to Provisioning Service. 
After execution of certain request from Self-service, Provisioning Service returns response about corresponding action 
happened with particular resource. Self-service, then, saves this response into Database. So, each time Self-Service 
receives request about status of provisioned infrastructure resources – it loads it from Database and propagates to Web UI.

## Billing

Billing is a module, which provides a loading of the billing report for the environment to the database. It can be 
running as part of the Self-Service or a separate process.

## Provisioning Service

The Provisioning Service is a RESTful service, which provides APIs for provisioning of the user’s infrastructure. 
Provisioning Service receives the request from Self-Service, afterwards it forms and sends a command to the docker 
to execute requested action. Docker executes the command and generates a response.json file. Provisioning service 
analyzes response.json and responds to initial request of Self-Service, providing status-related information of the instance.

## Security service

Security Service is RESTful service, which provides authorization API for Self-Service and Provisioning Service via LDAP.

## Docker

Docker is an infrastructure-provisioning module based on Docker service, which provides low-level actions for infrastructure management.

## Database

Database serves as a storage with description of user infrastructure, user’s settings and service information.

# Physical architecture <a name="Physical_architecture"></a>

The following diagrams demonstrate high-level physical architecture of DataLab in AWS, GCP and Azure.

### DataLab high level Architecture on AWS: 

![Physical architecture](doc/datalab_aws.png)

### DataLab high level Architecture on GCP:

![Physical architecture](doc/datalab_gcp.png)

### DataLab high level Architecture on Azure:

![Physical architecture](doc/datalab_azure.png)

## Main components

-   Self-service node (SSN)
-   Endpoint node
-   Edge node
-   Notebook node (Jupyter, Rstudio, etc.)
-   Data engine cluster
-   Data engine cluster as a service provided with Cloud

## Self-service node (SSN)

Creation of self-service node – is the first step for deploying DataLab. SSN is a main server with following pre-installed services:

-   DataLab Web UI – is Web user interface for managing/deploying all components of DataLab. It is accessible by the 
    following URL: http[s]://SSN\_Public\_IP\_or\_Public\_DNS
-   MongoDB – is a database, which contains part of DataLab’s configuration, user’s exploratory environments description 
    as well as user’s preferences.
-   Docker – used for building DataLab Docker containers, which will be used for provisioning other components.

Elastic(Static) IP address is assigned to an SSN Node, so you are free to stop|start it and and SSN node's IP address 
won’t change.

## Endpoint

This is a node which serves as a provisioning endpoint for DataLab resources. Endpoint machine is deployed separately from DataLab
installation and can be even deployed on a different cloud.

## Edge node

This node is used as a reverse-proxy server for the user. Through Edge node users can access Notebook via HTTPS. 
Edge Node has a Nginx reverse-proxy pre-installed.

## Notebook node

The next step is setting up a Notebook node (or a Notebook server). It is a server with pre-installed applications and 
libraries for data processing, data cleaning and transformations, numerical simulations, statistical modeling, machine 
learning, etc. Following analytical tools are currently supported in DataLab and can be installed on a Notebook node:

-   Jupyter
-   Jupyterlab
-   RStudio
-   Apache Zeppelin
-   TensorFlow + Jupyter
-   TensorFlow + RStudio
-   Deep Learning + Jupyter

Apache Spark is also installed for each of the analytical tools above.

**Note:** terms 'Apache Zeppelin' and 'Apache Spark' hereinafter may be referred to as 'Zeppelin' and 'Spark' 
respectively or may have original reference.

## Data engine cluster

After deploying Notebook node, user can create one of the cluster for it:
-   Data engine - Spark standalone cluster
-   Data engine service - cloud managed cluster platform (EMR for AWS or Dataproc for GCP)
That simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark to process and analyze vast amounts 
of data. Adding cluster is not mandatory and is only needed in case additional computational resources are required for 
job execution.
----------------------
# DataLab Deployment <a name="DataLab_Deployment"></a>

### Structure of main DataLab directory <a name="DataLab_directory"></a>

DataLab’s SSN node main directory structure is as follows:

    /opt  
     └───datalab  
         ├───conf  
         ├───sources  
         ├───template  
         ├───tmp  
         │   └───result  
         └───webapp  

-   conf – contains configuration for DataLab Web UI and back-end services;
-   sources – contains all Docker/Python scripts, templates and files for provisioning;
-   template – docker’s templates;
-   tmp –temporary directory of DataLab;
-   tmp/result – temporary directory for Docker’s response files;
-   webapp – contains all .jar files for DataLab Web UI and back-end
    services.

### Structure of log directory <a name="log_directory"></a>

SSN node structure of log directory is as follows:

    /var
     └───opt
         └───datalab
             └───log
                 ├───dataengine
                 ├───dateengine-service
                 ├───edge
                 ├───notebook
                 ├───project
                 └───ssn

These directories contain the log files for each template and for DataLab back-end services.
-   ssn – contains logs of back-end services;
-   provisioning.log – Provisioning Service log file;
-   security.log – Security Service log file;
-   selfservice.log – Self-Service log file;
-   edge, notebook, dataengine, dataengine-service – contains logs of Python scripts.

## Keycloak server <a name="Keycloak_server"></a>

**Keycloak** is used to manage user authentication instead of the aplication. To use existing server following 
  parameters must be specified either when running *DataLab* deployment script or in 
*/opt/datalab/conf/self-service.yml* and */opt/datalab/conf/provisioning.yml* files on SSN node.

| Parameter                | Description/Value             |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| keycloak_realm_name      |Keycloak Realm name            |
| keycloak_auth_server_url |Keycloak auth server URL       |
| keycloak_client_name     |Keycloak client name           |
| keycloak_client_secret   |Keycloak client secret         |
| keycloak_user            |Keycloak user                  |
| keycloak_user_password   |Keycloak user password         |

### Preparing environment for Keycloak deployment <a name="Env_for_DataLab"></a>
Keycloak can be deployed with Nginx proxy on instance using *deploy_keycloak.py* script. Currently it only works with HTTP.

Preparation steps for deployment:

- Create an VM instance with the following settings:
    - The instance should have access to Internet in order to install required prerequisites
    - Boot disk OS Image - Ubuntu 18.04
- Put private key that is used to connect to instance where Keycloak will be deployed somewhere on the instance where 
  deployment script will be executed.
- Install Git and clone DataLab repository</details>
### Executing deployment script
To build Keycloak node, following steps should be executed:
- Connect to the instance via SSH and run the following commands:
```
sudo su
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python-pip
pip install fabric==1.14.0
```
- Go to *datalab* directory
- Run *infrastructure-provisioning/scripts/deploy_keycloak/deploy_keycloak.py* deployment script:

```
/usr/bin/python infrastructure-provisioning/scripts/deploy_keycloak/deploy_keycloak.py --os_user ubuntu --keyfile ~/.ssh/key.pem --keycloak_realm_name test_realm_name  --keycloak_user admin --keycloak_user_password admin_password --public_ip_address XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
```

List of parameters for Keycloak node deployment:

| Parameter                 | Description/Value                                                                       |

## Self-Service Node <a name="Self_Service_Node"></a>

### Preparing environment for DataLab deployment <a name="Env_for_DataLab"></a>

Deployment of DataLab starts from creating Self-Service(SSN) node. DataLab can be deployed in AWS, Azure and Google cloud.

For each cloud provider, prerequisites are different.

<details><summary>In Amazon cloud <i>(click to expand)</i></summary>

Prerequisites:

DataLab can be deployed using the following two methods:
 - IAM user: DataLab deployment script is executed on local machine and uses IAM user permissions to create resources in AWS.
 - EC2 instance: DataLab deployment script is executed on EC2 instance prepared in advance and with attached IAM role. 
   Deployment script uses the attached IAM role to create resources in AWS.

**'IAM user' method prerequisites:**  
 
 - IAM user with created AWS access key ID and secret access key. These keys are provided as arguments for the 
   deployment script and are used to create resources in AWS.
 - Amazon EC2 Key Pair. This key is system and is used for configuring DataLab instances.
 - The following IAM [policy](#AWS_SSN_policy) should be attached to the IAM user in order to deploy DataLab.
 
 **'EC2 instance' method prerequisites:**
 
 - Amazon EC2 Key Pair. This key is system and is used for configuring DataLab instances.
 - EC2 instance where DataLab deployment script is executed. 
 - IAM role with the following IAM [policy](#AWS_SSN_policy) should be attached to the EC2 instance. 
 
 **Optional prerequisites for both methods:**
  
  - VPC ID. If VPC where DataLab should be deployed is already in place, then "VPC ID" should be provided for deployment 
    script. DataLab instances are deployed in this VPC.
  - Subnet ID. If Subnet where DataLab should be deployed is already in place, then "Subnet ID" should be provided for 
    deployment script. DataLab SSN node and users' Edge nodes are deployed in this Subnet.

To know azure\_offer\_number open [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to Subscriptions and open yours, then 
click Overview and you should see it under Offer ID property:

![Azure offer number](doc/azure_offer_number.png)

Please see [RateCard API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt219004.aspx) to get more details about 
azure\_offer\_number, azure\_currency, azure\_locale, azure\_region_info. These DataLab deploy properties correspond to 
RateCard API request parameters.

To have working billing functionality please review Billing configuration note and use proper parameters for SSN node 
deployment.

To use Data Lake Store please review Azure Data Lake usage pre-requisites note and use proper parameters for SSN node 
deployment.

**Note:** Azure Data Lake usage pre-requisites:

1. Configure application in Azure portal and grant proper permissions to it.
- Open *Azure Active Directory* tab, then *App registrations* and click *New application registration*
- Fill in ui form with the following parameters *Name* - put name of the new application, *Application type* - select 
  Native, *Sign-on URL* put any valid url as it will be updated later
- Grant proper permissions to the application. Select the application you just created on *App registration* view, then 
  click *Required permissions*, then *Add->Select an API-> In search field type MicrosoftAzureQueryService* and press 
  *Select*, then check the box *Have full access to the Azure Data Lake service* and save the changes. Repeat the same 
  actions for *Windows Azure Active Directory* API (available on *Required permissions->Add->Select an API*) and the 
  box *Sign in and read user profile*
- Get *Application ID* from application properties  it will be used as azure_application_id for deploy_dlap.py script
2. Usage of Data Lake resource predicts shared folder where all users can write or read any data. To manage access to 
   this folder please create ot use existing group in Active Directory. All users from this group will have RW access to 
   the shared folder. Put ID(in Active Directory) of the group as *azure_ad_group_id* parameter to deploy_datalab.py script
3. After execution of deploy_datalab.py script go to the application created in step 1 and change *Redirect URIs* value to 
   the https://SSN_HOSTNAME/ where SSN_HOSTNAME - SSN node hostname

After SSN node deployment following Azure resources will be created:

-   Resource group where all DataLab resources will be provisioned
-   SSN Virtual machine
-   Static public IP address dor SSN virtual machine
-   Network interface for SSN node
-   Security Group for SSN node (if it was specified, script will attach the provided one)
-   Virtual network and Subnet (if they have not been specified) for SSN and EDGE nodes
-   Storage account and blob container for necessary further dependencies and configuration files for Notebook nodes (such as .jar files, YARN configuration, etc.)
-   Storage account and blob container for collaboration between DataLab users
-   If support of Data Lake is enabled: Data Lake and shared directory will be created</details>

Gateway node (or an Edge node) is an instance(virtual machine) provisioned in a public subnet. It serves as an entry 
point for accessing user’s personal analytical environment. It is created by an end-user, whose public key will be 
uploaded there. Only via Edge node, DataLab user can access such application resources as notebook servers and dataengine 
clusters. Also, Edge Node is used to setup SOCKS proxy to access notebook servers via Web UI and SSH. Elastic(Static) 
IP address is assigned to an Edge Node. 

### Create

In order to create Edge node using DataLab Web UI – login and, click on the button “Upload” (Depending on authorization 
provider that was chosen on deployment stage, user may be taken from [LDAP](#LDAP_Authentication) or from 
[Azure AD (Oauth2)](#Azure_OAuth2_Authentication)). Choose user’s SSH public key and after that click on the button 
“Create”. Edge node will be deployed and corresponding instance (virtual machine) will be started.

## Notebook node <a name="Notebook_node"></a>

Notebook node is an instance (virtual machine), with preinstalled analytical software, needed dependencies and with 
pre-configured kernels and interpreters. It is the main part of personal analytical environment, which is setup by a 
data scientist. It can be Created, Stopped and Terminated. To support variety of analytical needs - Notebook node can 
be provisioned on any of cloud supported instance shape for your particular region. From analytical software, which is 
already pre-installed on a notebook node, end users can access (read/write) data stored on buckets/containers.

### Create

To create Notebook node, click on the “Create new” button. Then, in drop-down menu choose template type 
(jupyter/rstudio/zeppelin/tensor/etc.), enter notebook name and choose instance shape. After clicking the button 
“Create”, notebook node will be deployed and started.

## Dataengine-service cluster <a name="Dataengine-service_cluster"></a>

Dataengine-service is a cluster provided by cloud as a service (EMR on AWS) can be created if more computational 
resources are needed for executing analytical algorithms and models, triggered from analytical tools. Jobs execution 
will be scaled to a cluster mode increasing the performance and decreasing execution time.

### Create

To create dataengine-service cluster click on the “gear” button in Actions column, and click on “Add computational 
resources”. Specify dataengine-service version, fill in dataengine-service name, specify number of instances and 
instance shapes. Click on the “Create” button.

## Configuration files <a name="Configuration_files"></a>

DataLab configuration files are located on SSN node by following path:
-   /opt/datalab/conf ssn.yml – basic configuration for all java services;
-   provisioning.yml – Provisioning Service configuration file;for
-   security.yml – Security Service configuration file;
-   self-service.yml – Self-Service configuration file.

## Starting/Stopping services <a name="Starting_Stopping_services"></a>

All DataLab services running as OS services and have next syntax for
starting and stopping:
```
sudo supervisorctl {start | stop | status} [all | provserv | secserv | ui]
```
-   start – starting service or services;
-   stop – stopping service or services;
-   status – show status of service or services;
-   all – execute command for all services, this option is default;
-   provserv – execute command for Provisioning Service;
-   secserv – execute command for Security Service;
-   ui – execute command for Self-Service.

## DataLab Web UI <a name="DataLab_Web_UI"></a>

DataLab self service is listening to the secure 8443 port. This port is used for secure local communication with 
provisioning service.

There is also Nginx proxy server running on Self-Service node, which proxies remote connection to local 8443 port.
Nginx server is listening to both 80 and 443 ports by default. It means that you could access self-service Web UI using 
non-secure connections (80 port) or secure (443 port).

Establishing connection using 443 port you should take into account that DataLab uses self-signed certificate from the box, 
however you are free to switch Nginx to use your own domain-verified certificate.

To disable non-secure connection please do the following:
-   uncomment at /etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx_proxy.conf file rule that rewrites all requests from 80 to 443 port;
-   reload/restart Nginx web server.

To use your own certificate please do the following:
-   upload your certificate and key to Self-Service node;
-   specify at /etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx_proxy.conf file the correct path to your new ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key;
-   reload/restart Nginx web server.

## Billing report <a name="Billing_Report"></a>

<details><summary>AWS <i>(click to expand)</i></summary>

Billing module is implemented as a separate jar file and can be running in the follow modes:

-   part of Self-Service;
-   separate system process;
-   manual loading or use external scheduler;

The billing  module is running as part of the Self-Service (if billing was switched ON before SSN deployment). For 
details please refer to section [Self-Service Node](#Self_Service_Node). Otherwise, you should manually configure file 
billing.yml. See the descriptions how to do this in the configuration file. Please also note, that you should also add 
an entry in the Mongo database into collection:
```
{
    "_id": "conf_tag_resource_id",
    "Value": "<CONF_TAG_RESOURCE_ID>"
}
```
After you have configured the billing, you can run it as a process of Self-Service. To do this, in the configuration 
file self-service.yml set the property **BillingSchedulerEnabled** to **true** and restart the Self-Service:
```
sudo supervisorctl stop ui
sudo supervisorctl start ui
```
If you want to load report manually, or use external scheduler use following command:
```
java -jar /opt/datalab/webapp/lib/billing/billing-aws.x.y.jar --conf /opt/datalab/conf/billing.yml
or
java -cp /opt/datalab/webapp/lib/billing/billing-aws.x.y.jar com.epam.datalab.BillingTool --conf /opt/datalab/conf/billing.yml
```
If you want billing to work as a separate process from the Self-Service use following command:
```
java -cp /opt/datalab/webapp/lib/billing/billing-aws.x.y.jar com.epam.datalab.BillingScheduler --conf /opt/datalab/conf/billing.yml
```

**Note:** You can type ```-h``` or ```--help``` for usage details.

**Note:** Restore process required stopping services.

## GitLab server <a name="GitLab_server"></a>

Own GitLab server can be deployed from SSN node with script, which located in:

```datalab_path/tmp/gitlab```. Default: ```/opt/datalab/tmp/gitlab```

All initial configuration parameters located in ```gitlab.ini``` file.

Some of parameters are already setuped from SSN provisioning.

GitLab uses the same LDAP server as DataLab.

To deploy Gitlab server, set all needed parameters in ```gitlab.ini``` and run script:

```./gitlab_deploy.py --action [create/terminate]```

**Note:** Terminate process uses ```node_name``` to find instance.

**Note:** GitLab wouldn't be terminated with all environment termination process.

## Troubleshooting <a name="Troubleshooting"></a>

If the parameter datalab\_path of configuration file datalab.ini wasn’t changed, the path to DataLab service would default to:

-   /opt/datalab/ - main directory of DataLab service
-   /var/opt/datalab/log/ or /var/log/datalab/ - path to log files

To check logs of Docker containers run the following commands:
```
docker ps -a – to get list of containers which were executed.
...
a85d0d3c27aa docker.datalab-dataengine:latest "/root/entrypoint...." 2 hours ago Exited (0) 2 hours ago infallible_gallileo
6bc2afeb888e docker.datalab-jupyter:latest "/root/entrypoint...." 2 hours ago Exited (0) 2 hours ago practical_cori
51b71c5d4aa3 docker.datalab-zeppelin:latest "/root/entrypoint...." 2 hours ago Exited (0) 2 hours ago determined_knuth
...
docker logs <container_id> – to get log for particular Docker container.
```

To change Docker images on existing environment, you can run script on SSN node that rebuilds docker images with the command:
```
docker-build all  #to rebuild all images
```
or
```
docker-build <notebook_name> #to rebuild certain images
```

You can also rebuild images manually by executing the following steps:

1.  SSH to SSN instance
2.  go to */opt/datalab/sources/*
3.  Modify needed files
[4]. [ONLY FOR AZURE] Copy service principal json file with credentials to base/azure_auth.json
5.  Rebuild proper Docker images, using one or several commands (depending on what files you’ve changed):
```
docker build --build-arg OS=<os_family> --file general/files/<cloud_provider>/base_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-base .
docker build --build-arg OS=<os_family> --file general/files/<cloud_provider>/edge_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-edge .
docker build --build-arg OS=<os_family> --file general/files/<cloud_provider>/jupyter_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-jupyter .
docker build --build-arg OS=<os_family> --file general/files/<cloud_provider>/jupyterlab_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-jupyterlab .
docker build --build-arg OS=<os_family> --file general/files/<cloud_provider>/rstudio_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-rstudio .
docker build --build-arg OS=<os_family> --file general/files/<cloud_provider>/zeppelin_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-zeppelin .
docker build --build-arg OS=<os_family> --file general/files/<cloud_provider>/tensor_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-tensor .
docker build --build-arg OS=<os_family> --file general/files/<cloud_provider>/tensor-rstudio_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-tensor-rstudio .
docker build --build-arg OS=<os_family> --file general/files/<cloud_provider>/deeplearning_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-deeplearning .
docker build --build-arg OS=<os_family> --file general/files/<cloud_provider>/dataengine_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-dataengine .
```

## Pre-requisites <a name="Pre-requisites"></a>

In order to start development of Front-end Web UI part of DataLab - Git repository should be cloned and the following 
packages should be installed:

-   Git 1.7 or higher
-   Python 2.7 with library Fabric v1.14.0
-   Docker 1.12 - Infrastructure provisioning

## Java back-end services <a name="Java_back_end_services"></a>

### Java components description

#### Common

Common is a module, which wraps set of reusable code over services. Commonly reused functionality is as follows:

1.  Models
2.  REST client
3.  Mongo persistence DAO
4.  Security models and DAO

#### Self-Service

Self-Service provides REST based API’s. It tightly interacts with Provisioning Service and Security Service and actually 
delegates most of user\`s requests for execution.

| API class name                  | Supported actions                                     | Description            |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| BillingResource                 | Get billing invoice<br>Export billing invoice in CSV file  | Provides billing information. |
| ComputationalResource           | Configuration limits<br>Create<br>Terminate           | Used for computational resources management. |
| EdgeResource                    | Start<br>Stop<br>Status                               | Manage EDGE node.      |
| ExploratoryResource             | Create<br>Status<br>Start<br>Stop<br>Terminate        | Used for exploratory environment management. |
| GitCredsResource                | Update credentials<br>Get credentials                 | Used for exploratory environment management. |
| InfrastructureInfoResource      | Get info of environment<br>Get status of environment  | Used for obtaining statuses and additional information about provisioned resources |
| InfrastructureTemplatesResource | Get computation resources templates<br>Get exploratory environment templates | Used for getting exploratory/computational templates |
| KeyUploaderResource             | Check key<br>Upload key<br>Recover                    | Used for Gateway/EDGE node public key upload and further storing of this information in Mongo DB. |
| LibExploratoryResource          | Lib groups<br>Lib list<br>Lib search<br>Lib install   | User’s authentication. |
| SecurityResource                | Login<br>Authorize<br>Logout                          | User’s authentication. |
| UserSettingsResource            | Get settings<br>Save settings                         | User’s preferences.    |

Some class names may have endings like Aws or Azure(e.g. ComputationalResourceAws, ComputationalResourceAzure, etc...). 
It means that it's cloud specific class with a proper API


#### Provisioning Service

The Provisioning Service is key, REST based service for management of cloud specific or Docker based environment 
resources like computational, exploratory,
edge, etc.

| API class name            | Supported actions                       | Description                                                                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ComputationalResource     | Create<br>Terminate                     | Docker actions for computational resources management.                       |
| DockerResource            | Get Docker image<br>Run Docker image    | Requests and describes Docker images and templates.                          |
| EdgeResource              | Create<br>Start<br>Stop                 | Provides Docker actions for EDGE node management.                            |
| ExploratoryResource       | Create<br>Start<br>Stop<br>Terminate    | Provides Docker actions for working with exploratory environment management. |
| GitExploratoryResource    | Update git greds                        | Docker actions to provision git credentials to running notebooks             |
| InfrastructureResource    | Status                                  | Docker action for obtaining status of DataLab infrastructure instances.         |
| LibExploratoryResource    | Lib list<br>Install lib                 | Docker actions to install libraries on netobboks                             |

Some class names may have endings like Aws or Azure(e.g. ComputationalResourceAws, ComputationalResourceAzure, etc...). 
It means that it's cloud specific class with a proper API

#### Security service

Security service is REST based service for user authentication against LDAP/LDAP + AWS/Azure OAuth2 depending on module 
configuration and cloud provider.
LDAP only provides with authentication end point that allows to verify authenticity of users against LDAP instance.
If you use AWS cloud provider LDAP + AWS authentication could be useful as it allows to combine LDAP authentication and 
verification if user has any role in AWS account

DataLab provides OAuth2(client credentials and authorization code flow) security authorization mechanism for Azure users. 
This kind of authentication is required when you are going to use Data Lake. If Data Lake is not enabled you have two 
options LDAP or OAuth2
If OAuth2 is in use security-service validates user's permissions to configured permission scope(resource in Azure).
If Data Lake is enabled default permission scope(can be configured manually after deploy DataLab) is Data Lake Store 
account so only if user has any role in scope of Data Lake Store Account resource he/she will be allowed to log in
If Data Lake is disabled but Azure OAuth2 is in use default permission scope will be Resource Group where DataLab is 
created and only users who have any roles in the resource group will be allowed to log in.

## How to setup local development environment <a name="setup_local_environment"></a>

The development environment setup description is written with assumption that user already has installed Java8 (JDK), 
Maven3 and set environment variables (JAVA\_HOME, M2\_HOME).­­­­­­ The description will cover Mongo installation, Mongo 
user creation, filling initial data into Mongo, Node.js installation

### Install Mongo database

  * Download MongoDB from [https://www.mongodb.com/download-center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center)
  * Install database based on MongoDB instructions
  * Start DB server and create accounts
```
use admin
db.createUser(
   {
     user: "admin",
     pwd: "<password>",
     roles: [ { role: "dbAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" },
              { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" },
              { role: "readWriteAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
   }
)
use <database_name>
db.createUser(
   {
     user: "admin",
     pwd: "<password>",
     roles: [ "dbAdmin", "userAdmin", "readWrite" ]
   }
)
```

  * Load collections form file datalab/services/settings/(aws|azure)/mongo_settings.json

```
mongoimport -u admin -p <password> -d <database_name> -c settings mongo_settings.json
```

  * Load collections form file datalab/infrastructure-provisioning/src/ssn/files/mongo_roles.json

```
mongoimport -u admin -p <password> -d <database_name> --jsonArray -c roles mongo_roles.json
```

If this command doesn't work for you, try to check [https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.2/reference/program/mongoimport/](https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.2/reference/program/mongoimport/)
Or, use some UI client (f.e: [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) )
### Setting up environment options

  * Set option CLOUD_TYPE to aws/azure, DEV\_MODE to **true**, mongo database name and password in configuration file 
  datalab/infrastructure-provisioning/src/ssn/templates/ssn.yml

```
<#assign CLOUD_TYPE="aws">
...
<#assign DEV_MODE="true">
...
mongo:
  database: <database_name>
  password: <password>
```

  * Add system environment variable DATALAB\_CONF\_DIR=&lt;datalab\_root\_folder&gt;/datalab/infrastructure-provisioning/src/ssn/templates or create two symlinks in datalab/services/provisioning-service and datalab/services/self-service folders for file datalab/infrastructure-provisioning/src/ssn/templates/ssn.yml.

*Unix*

```
ln -s ../../infrastructure-provisioning/src/ssn/templates/ssn.yml ssn.yml
```

*Windows*

```
mklink ssn.yml ..\\..\\infrastructure-provisioning\\src\\ssn\\templates\\ssn.yml
```

  * For Unix system create two folders and grant permission for writing:

```
/var/opt/datalab/log/ssn
/opt/datalab/tmp/result
```

### Install Node.js

  * Download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)
  * Install Node.js
  * Make sure that the installation folder of Node.js has been added  to the system environment variable **PATH**
  * Install latest packages

```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Build Web UI components

  * Change folder to datalab/services/self-service/src/main/resources/webapp and install the dependencies from a package.json manifest

```
npm install
```
  * Replace CLOUD_PROVIDER options with aws|azure in dictionary file<br> datalab/services/self-service/src/main/resources/webapp/src/dictionary/global.dictionary.ts

```
import { NAMING_CONVENTION } from './(aws|azure).dictionary';

export * from './(aws|azure).dictionary';
```
  * Build web application

```
npm run build.prod
```

### Prepare HTTPS prerequisites

To enable a SSL connection the web server should have a Digital Certificate.
To create a server certificate, follow these steps:

  * Create the keystore.

  * Export the certificate from the keystore.

  * Sign the certificate.

  * Import the certificate into a truststore: a repository of certificates used for verifying the certificates. A 
  truststore typically contains more than one certificate.

Please find below set of commands to create certificate, depending on OS.

#### Create Unix/Ubuntu server certificate

Pay attention that the last command has to be executed with administrative permissions.
```
keytool -genkeypair -alias ssn -keyalg RSA -storepass KEYSTORE_PASSWORD -keypass KEYSTORE_PASSWORD -keystore ~/keys/ssn.keystore.jks -keysize 2048 -dname "CN=localhost"
keytool -exportcert -alias ssn -storepass KEYSTORE_PASSWORD -file ~/keys/ssn.crt -keystore ~/keys/ssn.keystore.jks
sudo keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -alias ssn -file ~/keys/ssn.crt -noprompt -storepass changeit -keystore ${JRE_HOME}/lib/security/cacerts
```
#### Create Windows server certificate

Pay attention that the last command has to be executed with administrative permissions.
To achieve this the command line (cmd) should be ran with administrative permissions.  
```
"%JRE_HOME%\bin\keytool" -genkeypair -alias ssn -keyalg RSA -storepass KEYSTORE_PASSWORD -keypass KEYSTORE_PASSWORD -keystore <DRIVE_LETTER>:\home\%USERNAME%\keys\ssn.keystore.jks -keysize 2048 -dname "CN=localhost"
"%JRE_HOME%\bin\keytool" -exportcert -alias ssn -storepass KEYSTORE_PASSWORD -file <DRIVE_LETTER>:\home\%USERNAME%\keys\ssn.crt -keystore <DRIVE_LETTER>:\home\%USERNAME%\keys\ssn.keystore.jks
"%JRE_HOME%\bin\keytool" -importcert -trustcacerts -alias ssn -file <DRIVE_LETTER>:\home\%USERNAME%\keys\ssn.crt -noprompt -storepass changeit -keystore "%JRE_HOME%\lib\security\cacerts"

Useful command
"%JRE_HOME%\bin\keytool" -list -alias ssn -storepass changeit -keystore "%JRE_HOME%\lib\security\cacerts"
"%JRE_HOME%\bin\keytool" -delete -alias ssn -storepass changeit -keystore "%JRE_HOME%\lib\security\cacerts"
```
Where the ```<DRIVE_LETTER>``` must be the drive letter where you run the DataLab.

### Set up config files

#### ssn.yml
 Open infrastructure-provisioning/src/ssn/templates/ssn.yml 
 
 * (23) KEYS_DIR -> path to keys dir with backslash
 * (30) CLOUD_TYPE -> CLOUD_PROVIDER to gcp
 * (34) DEV_MODE -> false to true
 * (40-42) change user, pass, db to created in prev step
 
 #### self-service.yml
  Open services/self-service/self-service.yml
  
   * (170) keycloakConfiguration
       * (171) redirectUri -> https://localhost:8443/
       * (172) realm -> DLAB_bhliva
       * (174) auth-server-url -> http://52.11.45.11:8080/auth
       * (178) resource -> sss
       * credentials
           * (180) secret -> [ASK_YOUR_ONBOARDING_ENGINEER]
         
 #### provisioning.yml
  Open services/provisioning-service/provisioning.yml
 
   * (93) keycloakConfiguration
        * (94) realm -> DLAB_bhliva
        * (96) auth-server-url -> http://52.11.45.11:8080/auth
        * (100) resource -> sss
        * credentials
            * (102) secret -> [ASK_YOUR_ONBOARDING_ENGINEER]
     
   * (104) cloudProperties
        * (125) imageEnabled -> true     
        * (133) stepCerts
          * (134) enabled -> true
           
## How to run locally <a name="run_locally"></a>

There is a possibility to run Self-Service and Provisioning Service locally. All requests from Provisioning Service to 
Docker are mocked and instance creation status will be persisted to Mongo (only without real impact on Docker and AWS). 
Security Service can\`t be running on local machine because of local LDAP mocking complexity.

Both services, Self-Service and Provisioning Service are dependent on datalab/provisioning-infrastructure/ssn/templates/ssn.yml
configuration file. Both services have main functions as entry point, SelfServiceApplication for Self-Service and ProvisioningServiceApplication for Provisioning Service. Services could be started by running main methods of these classes. Both main functions require two arguments:

  * Run mode (“server”)
  * Configuration file name (“self-service.yml” or “provisioning.yml”  depending on the service). Both files are located
  in root service directory. These configuration files contain service settings and are ready to use.

The services start up order does matter. Since Self-Service depends on Provisioning Service, the last should be started 
first and Self-Service afterwards. Services could be started from local IDEA (Eclipse or Intellij Idea) “Run” 
functionality of toolbox.

Run application flow is following:

 
  * Create and run provisioning-service configuration:
    * Create Application with name provisining-service-application
        * Main class: 
        ``` com.epam.datalab.backendapi.ProvisioningServiceApplication```
        * VM options:  ```-Ddocker.dir=[PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR]\infrastructure-provisioning\src\general\files\gcp```
        * Program arguments : ```server
                              [PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR]\services\provisioning-service\provisioning.yml```
        * Working directory:```[PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR]```
        * Use classpath of module: ```provisioning-servise```
        * PAY ATTENTION: JRE should be the same jre where created server certificate
        
    * Create and run self-service configuration:
      * Create Application with name self-service-application
          * Main class: 
          ``` com.epam.datalab.backendapi.SelfServiceApplication```
          * Program arguments : ```server
                                [PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR]/services/self-service/self-service.yml```
          * Working directory:```[PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR]```
          * Use classpath of module: ```self-service```
          * PAY ATTENTION: JRE should be the same jre where created server certificate
  * Try to access self-service Web UI by https://localhost:8443

    ├───scripts – OS/Cloud dependent Python scripts
    └───templates – OS/Cloud dependent templates

These directories may contain differentiation by operating system (Debian/RedHat) or cloud provider (AWS).

Directories of templates (SSN, Edge etc.) contain only scripts, which are OS and CLOUD independent.

If script/function is OS or CLOUD dependent, it should be located in appropriate directory/library in general folder.

The following table describes mostly used scripts:

| Script name/Path             | Description                                                                                      |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dockerfile                   | Used for building Docker images and represents which Python scripts, templates and other files are needed. Required for each template. |
| base/entrypoint.py           | This file is executed by Docker. It is responsible for setting environment variables, which are passed from Docker and for executing appropriate actions (script in general/api/). |
| base/scripts/\*.py           | Scripts, which are OS independent and are used in each template.                                 |
| general/api/\*.py            | API scripts, which execute appropriate function from fabfile.py.                                 |
| template\_name/fabfile.py    | Is the main file for template and contains all functions, which can be used as template actions. |
| template\_name/scripts/\*.py | Python scripts, which are used for template. They are OS and CLOUD independent.                  |
| general/lib/aws/\*.py        | Contains all functions related to AWS.                                                           |
| general/lib/os/              | This directory is divided by type of OS. All OS dependent functions are located here.            |
| general/lib/os/fab.py        | Contains OS independent functions used for multiple templates.                                   |
| general/scripts/             | Directory is divided by type of Cloud provider and OS.                                           |
| general/scripts/aws/\*.py    | Scripts, which are executed from fabfiles and AWS-specific. The first part of file name defines to which template this script is related to. For example:<br>common\_\*.py – can be executed from more than one template.<br>ssn\_\*.py – are used for SSN template.<br>edge\_\*.py – are used for Edge template. |
| general/scripts/os/\*.py     | Scripts, which are OS independent and can be executed from more than one template. |

##### Docker and python execution workflow on example of SSN node

-   Docker command for building images *docker.datalab-base* and *docker.datalab-ssn*:
```
sudo docker build --build-arg OS=debian  --file general/files/aws/base_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-base . ;
sudo docker build --build-arg OS=debian  --file general/files/aws/ssn_Dockerfile -t docker.datalab-ssn . ;
```
Example of SSN Docker file:
```
FROM docker.datalab-base:latest

ARG OS

COPY ssn/ /root/
COPY general/scripts/aws/ssn_* /root/scripts/
COPY general/lib/os/${OS}/ssn_lib.py /usr/lib/python2.7/datalab/ssn_lib.py
COPY general/files/aws/ssn_policy.json /root/files/
COPY general/templates/aws/jenkins_jobs /root/templates/jenkins_jobs

RUN chmod a+x /root/fabfile.py; \
    chmod a+x /root/scripts/*

RUN mkdir /project_tree
COPY . /project_tree
```
Using this Docker file, all required scripts and files will be copied to Docker container.

-   Docker command for building SSN:
```
docker run -i -v /root/KEYNAME.pem:/root/keys/KEYNAME.pem –v /web_app:/root/web_app -e "conf_os_family=debian" -e "conf_cloud_provider=aws" -e "conf_resource=ssn" -e "aws_ssn_instance_size=t2.medium" -e "aws_region=us-west-2" -e "aws_vpc_id=vpc-111111" -e "aws_subnet_id=subnet-111111" -e "aws_security_groups_ids=sg-11111,sg-22222,sg-33333" -e "conf_key_name=KEYNAME" -e "conf_service_base_name=datalab_test" -e "aws_access_key=Access_Key_ID" -e "aws_secret_access_key=Secret_Access_Key" -e "conf_tag_resource_id=datalab" docker.datalab-ssn --action create ;
```

-   Docker executes *entrypoint.py* script with action *create*. *Entrypoint.py* will set environment variables, 
    which were provided from Docker and execute *general/api/create.py* script:
```
    elif args.action == 'create':
        with hide('running'):
            local("/bin/create.py")
```
-   *general/api/create.py* will execute Fabric command with *run* action:
```
  try:
        local('cd /root; fab run')
```
-   Function *run()* in file *ssn/fabfile.py* will be executed. It will run two scripts *general/scripts/aws/ssn\_prepare.py*
    and *general/scripts/aws/ssn\_configure.py*:
```
    try:
        local("~/scripts/{}.py".format('ssn_prepare'))
    except Exception as err:
        traceback.print_exc()
        append_result("Failed preparing SSN node. Exception: " + str(err))
        sys.exit(1)

    try:
        local("~/scripts/{}.py".format('ssn_configure'))
    except Exception as err:
        traceback.print_exc()
        append_result("Failed configuring SSN node. Exception: " + str(err))
        sys.exit(1)
```
-   The scripts *general/scripts/<cloud_provider>/ssn\_prepare.py* an *general/scripts/<cloud_provider>/ssn\_configure.py* 
    will execute other Python scripts/functions for:
  1. *ssn\_prepate.py:*
    1. Creating configuration file (for AWS)
    2. Creating Cloud resources.
  2. *ssn\_configure.py:*
    1. Installing prerequisites
    2. Installing required packages
    3. Configuring Docker
    4. Configuring DataLab Web UI

-   If all scripts/function are executed successfully, Docker container will stop and SSN node will be created.

#### Example of Docker commands

SSN:

```
docker run -i -v <key_path><key_name>.pem:/root/keys/<key_name>.pem -e "region=<region>" -e "conf_service_base_name=<Infrastructure_Tag>" -e  “conf_resource=ssn" -e "aws_access_key=<Access_Key_ID>" -e "aws_secret_access_key=<Secret_Access_Key>" docker.datalab-ssn --action <action>
```
All parameters are listed in section "Self-ServiceNode" chapter.

Other images:
```
docker run -i -v /home/<user>/keys:/root/keys  -v /opt/datalab/tmp/result:/response -v /var/opt/datalab/log/<image>:/logs/<image>  -e <variable1> –e <variable2> docker.datalab-<image> --action <action>
```

#### How to add a new template

First of all, a new directory should be created in *infrastructure-provisioning/src/*.

For example: *infrastructure-provisioning/src/my-tool/*

The following scripts/directories are required to be created in the template directory:

    my-tool
    ├───scripts
    └───fabfile.py

fabfile.py – the main script, which contains main functions for this template such as run, stop, terminate, etc.

Here is example of *run*() function for Jupyter Notebook node:

Path: *infrastructure-provisioning/src/jupyter/fabfile.py*
```
def run():
    local_log_filename = "{}_{}_{}.log".format(os.environ['conf_resource'], os.environ['edge_user_name'], os.environ['request_id'])
    local_log_filepath = "/logs/" + os.environ['conf_resource'] + "/" + local_log_filename
    logging.basicConfig(format='%(levelname)-8s [%(asctime)s]  %(message)s',
                        level=logging.DEBUG,
                        filename=local_log_filepath)

    notebook_config = dict()
    notebook_config['uuid'] = str(uuid.uuid4())[:5]

    try:
        params = "--uuid {}".format(notebook_config['uuid'])
        local("~/scripts/{}.py {}".format('common_prepare_notebook', params))
    except Exception as err:
        traceback.print_exc()
        append_result("Failed preparing Notebook node.", str(err))
        sys.exit(1)

    try:
        params = "--uuid {}".format(notebook_config['uuid'])
        local("~/scripts/{}.py {}".format('jupyter_configure', params))
    except Exception as err:
        traceback.print_exc()
        append_result("Failed configuring Notebook node.", str(err))
        sys.exit(1)
```

This function describes process of creating Jupyter node. It is divided into two parts – prepare and configure. Prepare 
part is common for all notebook templates and responsible for creating of necessary cloud resources, such as EC2 
instances, etc. Configure part describes how the appropriate services will be installed.

To configure Jupyter node, the script *jupyter\_configure.py* is executed. This script describes steps for configuring 
Jupyter node. In each step, the appropriate Python script is executed.

For example:

Path: *infrastructure-provisioning/src/general/scripts/aws/jupyter\_configure.py*
```
    try:
        logging.info('[CONFIGURE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK INSTANCE]')
        print('[CONFIGURE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK INSTANCE]')
        params = "--hostname {} --keyfile {} --region {} --spark_version {} --hadoop_version {} --os_user {} --scala_version {}".\
            format(instance_hostname, keyfile_name, os.environ['aws_region'], os.environ['notebook_spark_version'],
                   os.environ['notebook_hadoop_version'], os.environ['conf_os_user'],
                   os.environ['notebook_scala_version'])
        try:
            local("~/scripts/{}.py {}".format('configure_jupyter_node', params))
```

In this step, the script *infrastructure-provisioning/src/jupyter/scripts/configure\_jupyter\_node.py* will be executed.

Example of script *infrastructure-provisioning/src/jupyter/scripts/configure\_jupyter\_node.py:*
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Configure connections")
    env['connection_attempts'] = 100
    env.key_filename = [args.keyfile]
    env.host_string = args.os_user + '@' + args.hostname

    print("Configuring notebook server.")
    try:
        if not exists('/home/' + args.os_user + '/.ensure_dir'):
            sudo('mkdir /home/' + args.os_user + '/.ensure_dir')
    except:
        sys.exit(1)

    print("Mount additional volume")
    prepare_disk(args.os_user)

    print("Install Java")
    ensure_jre_jdk(args.os_user)
```

This script call functions for configuring Jupyter node. If this function is OS dependent, it will be placed in 
*infrastructure-provisioning/src/general/lib/\<OS\_family\>/debian/notebook\_lib.py*

All functions in template directory (e.g. *infrastructure-provisioning/src/my-tool/*) should be OS and cloud independent.

All OS or cloud dependent functions should be placed in *infrastructure-provisioning/src/general/lib/* directory.

The following steps are required for each Notebook node:

-   Configure proxy on Notebook instance – the script *infrastructure-provisioning/src/general/scripts/os/notebook\_configure\_proxy.py*
-   Installing user’s key – the script *infrastructure-provisioning/src/base/scripts/install\_user\_key.py*

Other scripts, responsible for configuring Jupyter node are placed in *infrastructure-provisioning/src/jupyter/scripts/*

-   scripts directory – contains all required configuration scripts.


-   *infrastructure-provisioning/src/general/files/<cloud_provider>/my-tool_Dockerfile* – used for building template 
    Docker image and describes which files, scripts, templates are required and will be copied to template Docker image.
-   *infrastructure-provisioning/src/general/files/<cloud_provider>/my-tool_descriptsion.json* – JSON file for DataLab Web 
    UI. In this file you can specify:
  * exploratory\_environment\_shapes – list of EC2 shapes
  * exploratory\_environment\_versions – description of template

Example of this file for Jupyter node for AWS cloud:
```
{
  "exploratory_environment_shapes" :
  {
    "For testing" : [
      {"Size": "S", "Description": "Standard_DS1_v2", "Type": "Standard_DS1_v2","Ram": "3.5 GB","Cpu": "1", "Spot": "true", "SpotPctPrice": "70"}
    ],
    "Memory optimized" : [
      {"Size": "S", "Description": "Standard_E4s_v3", "Type": "Standard_E4s_v3","Ram": "32 GB","Cpu": "4"},
      {"Size": "M", "Description": "Standard_E16s_v3", "Type": "Standard_E16s_v3","Ram": "128 GB","Cpu": "16"},
      {"Size": "L", "Description": "Standard_E32s_v3", "Type": "Standard_E32s_v3","Ram": "256 GB","Cpu": "32"}
    ],
    "Compute optimized": [
      {"Size": "S", "Description": "Standard_F2s", "Type": "Standard_F2s","Ram": "4 GB","Cpu": "2"},
      {"Size": "M", "Description": "Standard_F8s", "Type": "Standard_F8s","Ram": "16.0 GB","Cpu": "8"},
      {"Size": "L", "Description": "Standard_F16s", "Type": "Standard_F16s","Ram": "32.0 GB","Cpu": "16"}
    ]
  },
  "exploratory_environment_versions" :
  [
    {
      "template_name": "Jupyter notebook 5.7.4",
      "description": "Base image with jupyter node creation routines",
      "environment_type": "exploratory",
      "version": "jupyter_notebook-5.7.4",
      "vendor": "Azure"
    }
  ]
}
```

Additionally, following directories could be created:

-   templates – directory for new templates;

-   files – directory for files used by newly added templates only;

All Docker images are being built while creating SSN node. To add newly created template, add it to the list of images 
in the following script:

Path: *infrastructure-provisioning/src/general/scripts/aws/ssn\_configure.py*
```
    try:
        logging.info('[CONFIGURING DOCKER AT SSN INSTANCE]')
        print('[CONFIGURING DOCKER AT SSN INSTANCE]')
        additional_config = [{"name": "base", "tag": "latest"},
                             {"name": "edge", "tag": "latest"},
                             {"name": "jupyter", "tag": "latest"},
                             {"name": "rstudio", "tag": "latest"},
                             {"name": "zeppelin", "tag": "latest"},
                             {"name": "tensor", "tag": "latest"},
                             {"name": "emr", "tag": "latest"}]
```
For example:
```
...

   {"name": "my-tool", "tag": "latest"},

...
```

## LDAP Authentication <a name="LDAP_Authentication"></a>

### Unified logging and group management

There are a few popular LDAP distributions on the market like Active Directory, Open LDap. That’s why some differences 
in configuration appear.
Also depending on customization, there might be differences in attributes configuration. For example the 
DN(distinguished name) may contain different attributes:

- **DN=CN=Name Surname,OU=groups,OU=EPAM,DC=Company,DC=Cloud**
- **DN=UID=UID#53,OU=groups,OU=Company,DC=Company,DC=Cloud**

**CN** vs **UID**.

The relation between users and groups also varies from vendor to vendor.

For example, in Open LDAP the group object may contain set (from 0 to many) attributes **"memberuid"** with values 
equal to user`s attribute **“uid”**.

However, in Active Directory the mappings are done based on other attributes.
On a group size there is attribute **"member"** (from 0 to many values) and its value is user`s **DN** (distinguished name).


To fit the unified way of LDAP usage, we introduced configuration file with set of properties and customized scripts 
(python and JavaScript based).
On backend side, all valuable attributes are further collected and passed to these scripts.
To apply some customization it is required to update a few properties in **security.yml** and customize the scripts.


### Properties overview

There are just a few properties based in which the customization could be done:
- **ldapBindTemplate: uid=%s,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com**
- **ldapBindAttribute: uid**
- **ldapSearchAttribute: uid**

Where the:
- **ldapBindTemplate** is a user`s DN template which should be filed with custom value. Here the template could be 
  changed: uid=%s,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com -> cn=%s,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com.
- **ldapBindAttribute** - this is a major attribute, on which the DN is based on. Usually it is any of: uid or cn, or email.
- **ldapSearchAttribute** - another attribute, based on which users will be looked up in LDAP.

Additional parameters that are populated during deployment and may be changed in future are:
- **ldapConnectionConfig.name: ldap user name**
- **ldapConnectionConfig.ldapHost: ldap host**
- **ldapConnectionConfig.ldapPort: ldap port**
- **ldapConnectionConfig.credentials: ldap credentials**

### Scripts overview

There are 3 scripts in security.yml:
- **userLookUp** (python based)    - responsible for user lookup in LDap and returns additional user`s attributes;
- **userInfo** (python based)      - enriches user with additional data;
- **groupInfo** (javascript based) – responsible for mapping between users and groups;

### Script structure

The scripts above were created to flexibly manage user`s security configuration. They all are part of **security.yml** 
configuration. All scripts have following structure:
    - **name**
    - **cache**
    - **expirationTimeMsec**
    - **scope**
    - **attributes**
    - **timeLimit**
    - **base**
    - **filter**
    - **searchResultProcessor:**
      - **language**
      - **code**

Major properties are:
- **attributes**             - list of attributes that will be retrieved from LDAP (-name, -cn, -uid, -member, etc);
- **filter**               - the filter, based on which the object will be retrieved from LDAP;
- **searchResultProcessor**    - optional. If only LDAP object attributes retrieving is required, this property should 
  be empty. For example, “userLookup” script only retrieves list of "attributes". Otherwise, code customization (like user enrichment, user to groups matching, etc.) should be added into sub-properties below:
  - **language**                - the script language - "python" or "JavaScript"
  - **code**                    - the script code.


### "userLookUp" script

Configuration properties:

- **ldapBindTemplate: 'cn=%s,ou=users,ou=alxn,dc=alexion,dc=cloud'**
- **ldapBindAttribute: cn**
- **ldapSearchAttribute: mail**

Script code:

    name: userLookUp
    cache: true
    expirationTimeMsec: 600000
    scope: SUBTREE
    attributes:
      - cn
      - gidNumber
      - mail
      - memberOf
    timeLimit: 0
    base: ou=users,ou=alxn,dc=alexion,dc=cloud
    filter: "(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(mail=%mail%))"

In the example above, the user login passed from GUI is a mail (**ldapSearchAttribute: mail**) and based on the filer 
(**filter: "(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(mail=%mail%))")** so, the service would search user by its **“mail”**.
If corresponding users are found - the script will return additional user`s attributes:
  - cn
  - gidNumber
  - mail
  - memberOf

User`s authentication into LDAP would be done for DN with following template **ldapBindTemplate: 'cn=%s,ou=users,ou=alxn,
dc=alexion,dc=cloud'**, where CN is attribute retrieved by  **“userLookUp”** script.

## Azure OAuth2 Authentication <a name="Azure_OAuth2_Authentication"></a>
DataLab supports OAuth2 authentication that is configured automatically in Security Service and Self Service after DataLab deployment.
Please see explanation details about configuration parameters for Self Service and Security Service below.
DataLab supports client credentials(username + password) and authorization code flow for authentication.
